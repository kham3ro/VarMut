@title CrowdfundingCampaign
@author Giovanni Bartolomeo
@notice This contract can be used for a Crowdfunding campaign, the Organizers start the campaign
and the collected money will be withdrawn from the beneficiaries. Each donator can donate to the contract
to support the beneficiaries directly and transparently.
This contract evolves into 3 states: 
STARTED - Contract deployed and waiting for organizers donations
ENDED - Campaign expired, the beneficiaries can withdraw the money
DONATION - Initial organizers' donations collected, contract ready to receive external donations
Is possible to setup milestones as a global rewarding system for the campaign or flag as a puntual rewarding system for the donators.
